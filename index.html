      Hi, My name is Randy Alexander, and I aspire to become a software engineer, for as a child, I was always found of computers and their functions. My family, however, were unsure on how to guide me with the interest in computers as a viable career path since they were only exposed to hard labor work, such as construction and housekeeping. During Covid-19 pandemic, I took classes at Code Ramp, a beginnerâ€™s level coding program provided by Code Tenderloin, a non-profit workforce organization aiming to secure long-term employment for underserved communities in San Francisco. Moreover, I am proud to participate as student in the Code The Dream Bootcamp, a program that aims to promote equity in education by providing equal opportunities to students of all diverse backgrounds and abilities to further develop valuable professional skills while inspiring students to achieve success.  Along with my continued progress, I'm set to gain hands-on experience through this bootcamp program to further my professional skills to get started in a software engineer career.
